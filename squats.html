  <h1>Squats</h1>
<p>
Want to get a well-shaped butt and wonderful toned legs? Hereâ€™s   an exercise that focuses on your lower body strengthening the hamstrings, hips, quadriceps and gluts. Furthermore, it strengthens the core muscles keeping your posture straightened. Try to also sneak in some cardio squat jumps in which you hop up and land in a squat position and you also get your heart rate boosted.
