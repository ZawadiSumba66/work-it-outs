  <h1>Push ups</h1>
<p>
Build your muscle density with this incredible indoor workout. It strengthens the back muscles and biceps at the same time boosting the cardiovascular system. Pushups also enhance your posture as it fine tones your core muscles responsible for posture. On a mat, raise yourself in a horizontal position with your palms on the floor and your arms vertical to them. Up and down in the same position .Try this 15 times. Very exhausting I bet but also fulfilling at the end of the day.
