  <h1>Jumping Jacks</h1>
<p>
A major throwback to our childhood life and it does not feel anything clos e to an exercise. Well, this indoor workout is a very great warm up exercise. It improves oneâ€™s stamina stimulating the heart muscles therefore increasing the metabolic rate. It can even be considered as a good muscle toner. Wanna shape your arms and thighs and shed that fat under you r arms. Then look no further it also relieves stress as it stimulates the brain to release a hormone that gives you a rush of excitement.

  You will absolutely want to try this and make your way through the day energized. All you need is to spread your arms wide as you jump high. Try this15 times in 3 sets and you are good to go.
